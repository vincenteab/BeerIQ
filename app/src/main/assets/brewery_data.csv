Founded by locals with a passion for the Coast, the 101 epitomizes the Gibsons lifestyle — it is a community hub where people gather together to enjoy well made craft beer, small batch spirits, and locally inspired food. Located in Gibsons right on the Sunshine Coast Highway, the 101 is a great spot to stop any time of year — the patio is definitely an attraction in warmer months, but inside is equally welcoming with comfy booths and long tables for socializing, as well as an upper mezzanine level. This is the West Coast beyond compare. On BC's southwest coast lies a hidden paradise of coastal geography awaiting discovery — along with some of the province's most distinctive breweries in Gibsons, Sechelt and Powell River."

You can pop in for an espresso first thing, sit in for some lunch later on, then enjoy a post-shift pint and some snacks or pizza. The weekend brunch waffles, meanwhile, have become something of a minor sensation. The lounge is certainly a place worth lingering. Simply but impeccably designed, its clean, whitewashed interior remains welcoming and comfortable, with strategically placed greenery and tall windows offering lots of natural light.

A few months later, he returned with a truck and trailer to haul the equipment up to Fort St. John. For the brewery, they selected a building he knew well: it had previously housed an MMA gym where he taught jiu-jitsu. Its location right on the historic Alaska Highway was perfect. Stephen and Amy renovated and installed the equipment themselves and in short order Beard's Brewing Co. opened as Fort St. John's first craft brewery. Since then the brewery has developed a strong local following for its range of beers — many of which include the word “Beard” in the name: Red Beard, White Beard, Black Beard, etc. Ironically, as a working firefighter, Stephen is not allowed to grow a beard himself so he doesn't resemble the prototypical bearded, hipster brewer. The beer lineup is diverse with a strong focus on honey beers — all the honey comes from a local farmer. While the brewery does not have a kitchen, food trucks are usually parked outside. In addition to the patio, which was added during the pandemic, the brewery hopes to add a rooftop patio one day. Prepare to be awed by the vast geography of rugged mountains, pristine lakes and rolling prairies found alongside the craft breweries of Fort St John, Dawson Creek, Quesnel, Williams Lake and Valemount."
The Beer Farmers,"8324 Meadows Rd, Pemberton, BC V0N 2L2",50.4039641,-122.8863753,Craft beer by farmers who became brewers.,"For many farmers, inviting guests over for dinner might involve preparing a roast dinner with fresh produce from the farm or a home-made apple pie with apples plucked from the orchard. For Brenda Miller, it was always about sharing her home-brewed craft beer. After four generations of farming, the promise of that beer led the Miller family to ask themselves a simple question: what if? Answering that question led them to achieve their dream of building their own family-run, farm-based brewery. If you venture beyond the small country town of Pemberton and follow the meandering roads of the Meadows deep into the valley, you won't be disappointed by what you find. The Beer Farmers is nestled between majestic mountaintops and farmland crops, based out of a charming, rustic barn on land that has been farmed by the Millers since the 1890s. Steeped in history, the Beer Farmers offers local craft beer at its finest—farmed, brewed, and poured all in one place, bringing locals and like-minded people together. Soak up the summer sun on the spacious outdoor patio or get warm and cozy on those cold winter days inside their large indoor tasting room. Sip on farm-fresh beer, dine on delicious, locally-sourced food, and experience the taste of the Pemberton Valley at The Beer Farmers."

The father and son who opened this brewery boast the last name Beere. They like to say it was inevitable that they'd open their own brewery. They did so in 2017, kicking off a mini boom of breweries in the Lonsdale Waterfront area that has come to be coined the Shipyards Brewery District of North Vancouver. With its stylish logo and highly marketable image, Beere Brewing would probably succeed making average beer, but the fact is this place has truly made a name for itself by brewing excellent beers: brewer Matt Beere's focus is on fruity, citrusy hazy IPAs, but he also likes to double dry hop everything from Pale Ales to Pilsners, and releases the occasional farmhouse saison or sour ale for good measure. The water-facing, street-front tasting room is a cozy, welcoming spot just a short distance from Lonsdale Quay and the very useful Seabus, as well as several other breweries that have popped up since this place paved the way here.

When BNA's founders first saw the interior of this building as they scouted locations for their dream brewery, they knew they could turn it into something special. And they were right. Located in the heart of Kelowna's cultural district, it is a beautiful space enlivened by old wood and bricks, giant pillars, and an eclectic assortment of old and new furniture. Lounge on a couch, join a group of new friends at a long table, or tuck into a booth with a special someone. There's a shuffleboard table, an indoor bocce court, and even a bowling alley upstairs. The tasting room features Skee Ball, arcade videogames, and a dart board to keep you occupied while you're sipping the delicious beers on offer. BNA works with local companies, and its chef sources ingredients locally to feature in his gourmet creations. Award-winning Chef Justin Best's creations can be enjoyed in both the Tasting Room and the Eatery. Both menus feature an eclectic mix of classic pub favourites and internationally-inspired dishes, each with his signature flavourful style. The beer lineup, which is an exciting mix of solid standards and innovative experiments, has become so popular that BNA had to add fermentation tanks in a building a couple doors down — with the beer getting piped over the roof of the business in between. BNA is named after the building it occupies. The British North American Tobacco Company built it to dry tobacco leaves and roll cigars in the early 1900s. Later, when fruit became the main agricultural crop in the area, it became a fruit cannery, but since the 1960s, the space was largely unused — until BNA's founders saw it and began dreaming about what they could do with it. This region's craft beer scene dates back 25 years, and a recent surge of new breweries and its own annual beer festival has given it fresh energy."

Brassneck Brewery,"2148 Main St, Vancouver, BC V5T 3C5",49.2657547,-123.1005715,This brewery is as local as it gets.,"Brassneck opened in 2013 as part of a wave of new breweries that revitalized Vancouver's previously slumbering craft beer community. For the first few years, its beers were only available on site, but while that has changed, many of the beers are still only available there, and anyway, you really need to visit in person to get the full Brassneck experience. Brewer Conrad Gmoser spent 17 years perfecting his craft at Steamworks Brewpub, and he loves variety so there is always something unique and special to try. Expect pitch-perfect versions of classic beer styles alongside boundary-pushing experimental brews and re-imagined hybrids. No beer lover's visit to Vancouver is complete without a stop here. Brassneck is one of the best places, if not the best, to drink beer in British Columbia. Before partnering with Conrad Gmoser to open Brassneck, publican Nigel Springthorpe made a name for himself at the Alibi Room, a Gastown restaurant that became Vancouver's craft beer headquarters under his leadership. In 2006, when Springthorpe went from employee to co-owner and manager, he was just starting to get interested in craft beer. He began seeking out new and interesting beers to put on, and the row of taps grew up to 50, plus three dedicated cask engines. The city's beer lovers flocked there, and brewers clamoured to get their beers put on tap. It was British Columbia's first taphouse, a model that has since been replicated dozens of times elsewhere. While the Alibi has moved on to new owners, Springthorpe has since opened the Magnet, a craft beer focused bar and restaurant downtown on West Pender.

It was a very complicated construction project, but the results are impressive indeed. The two-level space has plenty of options for customers to explore: the central bar offers eight taps of beer served directly from the tanks in the brewery, which occupies the east end of the building; wine and cocktails on tap; and nostalgic comfort food, including burgers, pizza, and build-your-own bowls. On top of the eight pipeline taps, they also have 14 guest taps that are filled with cool craft brews and ciders from around BC, with the occasional specialty from outside of the province. There is an assortment of fun arcade games and pinball machines, and a big screen where you can watch the big game. Upstairs on the mezzanine, the DRINKLAB space offers whisky and fine spirits flights along with handcrafted cocktails. The vibe is casual and fun — everyone is welcome from solo diners to couples out for a date and groups of friends looking for fun. The indoor space is large enough to accommodate lots of people, and there are two patios for those who want to stay outside. Collaborating with other breweries has been the focus of the beer program here from the start.

For a long time after it opened in 1997 it was the only place in the Village to enjoy craft beer since the bars and restaurants there were dominated by big, international mega-brands. Thankfully, that has changed in recent years, but regardless, the BrewHouse is still the best place to enjoy authentic craft beer. Brewer Derrick Franche has a great reputation for cask conditioning, and his entire beer lineup is solid and worth checking out. The brewpub has a good kitchen, with a sit-down restaurant on one side and a bar on the other. Kids are welcome in the restaurant area and will be enthralled by the electric train that runs around the entire complex on an elevated track. The BrewHouse's 5 Rings IPA was named best IPA at the BC Beer Awards in 2012 and 2014. It continues to be one of the best IPAs in the province, but it's only available at the BrewHouse.

He is excited to be making a leap from boiling five gallons on a turkey burner to brewing on the big system in the brewery. It was very challenging to build and open the brewery during the COVID pandemic, but as a journeyman woodworker, Kris was able to build out much of the brewery himself, limiting the number of tradespeople in the building. Bricklayer's tasting room has a retro-modern vibe with comfy bar stools, booths, and lots of brick accents throughout. There is also a patio with room to spread out. Although no kitchen is on-site, Bricklayer offers focaccia-style pizzas and soft pretzels made by a local bakery, along with charcuterie, olives, and other snacks.

Apparently, they each have a buffalo tattoo to acknowledge that connection. The second part has to do with Liam's red hair — his side business, a plumbing company, is called Red Giant Plumbing. But what sealed the deal was when a friend referred to him as “Papa Rouge.” Voila: Buffalo Rouge. When Liam and Crystal met, she was running a food truck called The Grub Wagon. Later, when they moved to Kelowna, they brought the food truck with them and have been operating it as The Wagon there ever since, featuring an exclusively vegetarian menu. That focus has been carried over to the kitchen menu at Buffalo Rouge.

Connector Brewing,"101 - 3310 Carrington Rd, West Kelowna, BC V4T 3C1",49.838943,-119.61011,Community focused. Locally crafted.

Connector offers approachable beer styles and alternative beverages, delicious plant-based eats, and fun events. Founded by partners Rebecca and Colton who developed a love for craft beer and each other while exploring breweries all over British Columbia.

Founders Dan Webster and Terry Brown wanted to create a space that will bring the people of East Vancouver, and beyond, together to enjoy great beer in a comfortable environment. The two-level lounge and tasting room with large windows face the North Shore mountains; opening up on the hot summer days, this lounge and new outdoor patio is the place to be year-round. Container Brewing focuses on classic beer styles with a modern twist where needed — the intention is to bring a highly drinkable range of beer that will have you asking for another. The beer line-up is influenced by founding head brewer Tim Juul's background in the New England beer scene and has since been pushed further by current head brewer, David Dayco. That means you can rely on the quality of Container's Hazy IPAs and expect some interesting variations in the brewery's west coast styles. The beer sits alongside a great food truck partnership with Burdy, who creates a number of wonderful handheld sandwiches amongst other offerings.

This is not a place where you will have to worry about feeling like you don't know enough to order a beer. With 20 taps offering a range of approachable options, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and a comfortable environment, this is the ideal spot to get more acquainted with the world of craft beer. Beers like the bourbon barrel-aged Imperial Stout are good options for those seeking something a little more crafty. In early 2022, the brewery purchased the restaurant next door and began serving a full food menu from its kitchen. Options include a range of gourmet hot dogs and burgers, wings, salads, sandwiches and more. Along with the beer, the taproom also has wine, cider, and beer-themed cocktails available for those who are looking for other options. The name Copper is in honour of the co-founder's dog who adorns the brewery's cans. It also refers to the copper-clad boil kettle and mash tun in the brewery itself, which is run by Richard Fukumoto, who grew up in nearby Salmon Arm, trained in England, and then worked at a variety of breweries before returning to the Okanagan to take the job here. Dog fans will love this brewery. In addition to its dog-themed can labels, the patio is dog-friendly and the tasting room has a wall covered in photos of dogs who have visited the brewery. Bring your own canine along to add his or her portrait. Copper Brewing's co-founders make a perfect team. Sean's grandparents ran a home beer and wine supply store in Edmonton where he grow up, and he began home brewing as soon as he turned 18, eventually developing a dream to open a brewery of his own. Meanwhile, Darla worked in the wine industry, but harboured her own dreams of opening a brewery. When they met at a wedding where their friends were getting married to each other (Sean actually brewed the beer that was served at the wedding), they discovered their shared dream of opening a brewery and decided to form a business partnership. As a carpenter and civil engineering technologist, Sean was able to do much of the work building out the brewery, and when it came to opening and running the tasting room, Darla's experience in the wine world kicked in. This region's craft beer scene dates back 25 years, and a recent surge of new breweries and its own annual beer festival has given it fresh energy."

During the winter, tours are available as weather permits. Call the brewery directly to book a tour. This brewery was founded in 2001 by two ardently political brewers, Rebecca Kneen and Brian McIsaac, who left busy urban lifestyles in Vancouver behind to create this unique brewery on a ten-acre piece of land located halfway between Kamloops and Salmon Arm. They brew only organic ales, focusing on local and seasonal specialty ingredients, most of which come from their own farm. Their experiences growing their own hops led Rebecca to publish a manual on hop growing, which in turn has helped spark a revival in hop growing throughout British Columbia. The whole operation is sustainable, with the farm's pigs gobbling up much of the brewery's by-products, and they have purposefully chosen not to grow beyond the footprint of their farm itself. If that means that it's not very easy to get your hands on Crannóg's beers, so be it. Plan your visit well ahead: pre-filled growlers are available for sale from Thursdays to Saturdays only. Check the website to confirm hours or check the current list of where their beer is served throughout BC to try it elsewhere. Crannóg celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2020. Some of Crannóg's brewing equipment was originally part of Canada's first microbrewery built in Horseshoe Bay, BC, in 1982. From Merritt up to Kamloops, across to Salmon Arm, and then down to Vernon, the craft breweries on this ale trail reflect the geographic diversity of the region with their own individual approaches.

The brewery doesn't package its beer in cans or bottles, which means you have to go to the source to enjoy it. You can enjoy food from CBC's own kitchen, or visit the brewery's partner restaurant, Riders Pizza, across the street, which offers another place to enjoy the beer along with amazing pizza. Once upon a time, an ex-actor-turned-airplane mechanic named Darren and his wife Michelle walked into Rider's Pizza for dinner. They complimented the owners Mike and Caroline about the delicious pizza, and then learned that before becoming a pizza maker Mike had been a brewer. After working at Spinnakers Brewpub in Victoria he had opened Wild Rose Brewing in Alberta. By the end of the evening, Darren, Michelle, Mike and Caroline had hatched a plan to open their own brewery. The rest is Cumberland history.

Dageraad Brewing,"3191 Thunderbird Crescent #114, Burnaby, BC V5A 3G1",49.2559693,-122.9221527,Crafted in the Belgian tradition. Brewed in British Columbia.,"In his younger days, Ben Coli spent a lot of time travelling the world on a budget, and during his travels he befriended some Belgians. In the ensuing years he often visited them in Antwerp, Belgium, where they would sit at one of many cafés in the local square, which was called the Dageraadplaats (“sunrise square” in Flemish), and sip Belgian beers. Each time he returned home to Vancouver, Ben would miss his friends, of course, but he also lamented the many styles of Belgian beer he could not enjoy here. After one such trip, he decided to try his luck brewing a Belgian-style beer at home. He was convinced it would be a failure, but instead, his first attempt was incredible – fruity, spicy, complex, but light and drinkable. He was hooked. Interest grew into obsession, and he began a period of intensive study, including brewing school and two beer sabbaticals in Belgium where he picked Belgian brewers' brains to discover what made their beer so amazing. And he returned to the Dageraadplaats again and again. When Dageraad Brewing finally opened in Burnaby, it was initially a small affair focused on two beers to start, Dageraad Amber and Blonde. Since then, the brewery has expanded considerably, and now features a gorgeous tasting room with a design that matches the branding's fin de siècle elegance. And although the Amber and Blonde are still the anchors, Dageraad's beer lineup is diverse, extensive, and delicious. Dageraad was named Canadian Brewery of the Year in 2018.  The four municipalities of New Westminster, Burnaby, Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam are aligned in many ways — not just by geography, but also through their bustling craft breweries."

The lack of an IPA in the lineup was surprising, but then the brewery released Sartori Harvest IPA, BC's first wet-hopped IPA, in 2009 and followed it up by launching Fat Tug IPA on a year-round basis in 2010. Fat Tug quickly became regarded as BC's best IPA and was named Beer of the Year at the Canadian Brewing Awards in 2011. Although Fat Tug fills more than half of Driftwood's fermentation tanks on a regular basis, the brewery also has a significant barrel-aging/sour beer program and continues to innovate with regular new releases. The brewery moved to its new location just off the E&N Rail Trail in the heart of Old Esquimalt in 2021, adding significant capacity as well as a popular tasting room and patio. Food is available from Dumpling Drop, which operates out of the tasting room kitchen, and the lineup of taps usually includes something unique from a pilot batch system. Driftwood also offers its own distilled gin and vodka under the Driftwood Spirits brand. Driftwood's barrel-aged sour beer program is called the Bird of Prey series, a name inspired by a Cooper's hawk that took residence in the brewery one evening. Each of Driftwood's sour beer labels features a bird of prey, including a peregrine falcon on De Aurus, a great horned owl on Obscuritas and the Cooper's hawk on Latus.

East Van is our beer.,"Craft beer has been part of East Vancouver culture from the earliest days of the microbrewing movement. One of the city's early beer pioneers, Shaftebury Brewing, was situated there, and Storm Brewing also set up shop there in the ‘90s, long before East Van was a cool place to be. Over the past decade, a wave of new breweries has opened there, including this one, which named itself after the neighbourhood. The brewery was the brainchild of the owner of the London Pub who registered the name in 2012 as he saw a wave of new breweries opening in the city, and then waited for the right space to open up. The East Vancouver Brewing Co. finally opened five years later. It has a sizeable tasting room inside with a temporary mezzanine space upstairs to allow for physical distancing and has recently opened a patio on the sidewalk with a great view of downtown Vancouver. Beer-wise, East Van has 12 taps featuring a solid core line-up along with rotating seasonals so you know you will always find something fresh and interesting. Its taproom kitchen features paninis, calzones, and other snacks from Bianca Maria, a local Italian delicatessen that has been operating for 60 years. It doesn't get any more East Van than that!

But it's the brewery's fresh and creative beer lineup that keeps customers returning. The name reflects the fact that the building previously housed a company that made electric bicycles, but the brewery has really made it its own.

Unfortunately, because it is situated on the Coquihalla Highway halfway to Kamloops, many of us have only ever driven through Merritt or stopped there for lunch. Now, with the addition of its very own craft brewery, we all have incentive to plan for a longer stay! The Empty Keg Brew House is the dream of the husband and wife team of Kelly and Kyle Hall. Kyle was an avid homebrewer who kept his friends and relations happy for years by sharing his delicious beer with them. About 10 years ago, one of them said, “Your beer is so good — if you ever open a brewery you'll never be able to keep the kegs full.“ And that was where the brewery's name came from. Empty Keg offers a rotating range of beers with something suited to every taste. Hall says his recipe book is the thickness of an encyclopedia and he has only just scratched the surface since he opened in May 2019. He likes to work with local ingredients as much as possible, including hops from Sunshine Valley Hops, which is 10 minutes away, and honey from local apiaries. He also makes hard seltzers on site and mixes radlers on demand. The Empty Keg Brew House was voted Merritt's “Best New Business of the Year” in 2020 in the Merritt Herald.

Erie Creek Brewing,"117 4th St, Salmo, BC V0G 1Z0",49.193258,-117.27843,Enjoy Kootenay crafted beer in this small town brewery.,"An old adage says that every town should have its own brewery, and that was certainly one of the incentives behind opening Erie Creek Brewing. When Colin and Lynn Hango moved their family from Nelson to an acreage in Salmo, they saw the need for a community hangout, a place for people to get together and enjoy a craft beer. Colin had been home brewing for several years, so they decided to take the plunge and open their own brewery. For their location they picked an old bank. The brewery is downstairs, which leaves lots of room upstairs — the lounge features a stage where musicians play three times a week. Even the vault was converted into a cozy space with a couch, reminiscent of a living room. Many locals who never tried craft beer before have become regulars, enjoying Erie Creek's Cream Ale instead of the macro lager they used to drink. The local water is clean and pure, which gives Hango a solid base for brewing traditional beer styles well. It's a small operation so there is always something new and interesting to try. Drop by for a flight, order in some food from a nearby restaurant, and fill a growler to take away with you. Salmo is conveniently located just a half hour from Nelson, Trail, Rossland and Castlegar, which makes it an ideal destination for people looking to try out a new brewery. Add in mountain biking or skiing opportunities at the Salmo Ski Hill or the nearby Whitewater Ski Resort and you might just want to join the crowd of people choosing to move to Salmo. Discover forests, mountains, pristine lakes and rivers, hot springs and waterfalls as you explore craft breweries in Rossland, Trail, Salmo, Castlegar, Robson, Nelson and Kaslo."
Faculty Brewing Co.,"1830 Ontario St, Vancouver, BC V5T 2W6",49.2686076,-123.1044505,An open-source brewery designed to educate and empower beer learners.,"Faculty Brewing was founded by a husband-and-wife team: Maurico, a Food Engineer, and Alicia, an architect who designed the brewery. Mauricio moved to Vancouver in 2008 to complete his Master's in Food Science at UBC, and later worked as a post-secondary instructor. It was that experience that led to the name and concept behind Faculty: the brewery is designed to educate and empower people with craft beer knowledge; Faculty shares information about the brewing process and even publishes all its beer recipes. Like a university or college, the brewery is meant to be a place of idea-sharing and collaboration — they work with other breweries and local home brewers to test new recipes and experiment with innovative ideas. Appropriately, Faculty's Head Brewer, Jacquie Loehndorf, is a graduate of the Brewing & Brewery Operations program at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Langley. Faculty's beer names include a number system similar to how universities and colleges number courses by their level of complexity and expertise. Lower numbers indicate a more entry-level beer, while higher numbers are reserved for more experimental and boldly flavoured beers. The brewery has a partnership with Oddity Kombucha, and the two businesses share a small tasting room and patio. From the Downtown brewpubs to Kitsilano and Mount Pleasant's diverse range of small, local breweries, there is a beer and brewery for every taste on the Brewery Creek Vancouver Ale Trail."

Farm Country is part of a revitalization of Langley City's traditional downtown core, operating collaboratively as a member of the “Langley Loop,” which celebrates the local craft beer community. The friendly, retro style of the brewery's branding evokes a Classic Country vibe, with beautifully designed posters and attention-getting labels. Every can features the Brewer's Guarantee that “It's tasty beer!” with the smiling face of Jack Bensley, Head Brewer. Well known and respected in the BC brewing community, Bensley honed his craft first at Russell Brewing and then at Main Street Brewing in Vancouver. He consulted with Farm Country to help them develop their business plan, and then decided to join the team himself as Head Brewer.

Farmhouse Brewing Co.,"6385 Lickman Rd, Chilliwack, BC V2R 4A9",49.117699,-122.0072028,Chilliwack's only farm-based brewery.,"There are only a handful of farm-based breweries in British Columbia, and even among those, very few grow their own barley and hops because of the amount and type of land required. However, Farmhouse Brewing is doing just that on its 11.5-acre farm in the Greendale area of Chilliwack. Founded by a husband-and-wife team with three children who had previously operated a smaller hobby farm, the brewery is located in a custom-built facility with a tasting room, heated patio and outdoor picnic areas. Outside features a children's playground, professional mini-golf for ages 16+ and an outdoor bar. The 18-tap tasting room kitchen features artisan-style food pairings utilizing a large Forno Bravo oven along with other appies and snacks. For dessert, how about cheesecake or Farmhouse s'mores featuring beer marshmallow, graham cracker chocolate chip cookies and chocolate pot de creme. Please note that as Farmhouse is located on ALR (farm land), the tasting lounge and brewery have different rules and regulations relating to service than other local breweries. The tasting lounge is limited to bar service. While alcohol can't be served to tables, food will be brought out as it is ready. Farmhouse strives to give the best service possible within these limits. This is a family-friendly spot with lots of outdoor space where kids can play while parents are enjoying their beverages and food pairings. The tasting room also serves non-alcoholic beer and various drink options including local kombucha on tap. There is a playground for kiddos and a professional putting course for grown-up kids.

At first, thanks to all the ski hills around Fernie, it was busier in the winter than it was in the summer, which is usually a brewery's busiest season. Before long it was popular enough to be busy year-round, and in 2007 the brewery moved into its own purpose-built facility on the highway just outside the town centre. Since then, Fernie Brewing has grown into one of British Columbia's most successful breweries, distributing its beer throughout BC and across the prairie provinces. Since 2013, Fernie has been producing a series of beers called the Rotating IPA Series. These seasonal releases showcase the IPA style in all its varied glory, and have included Off Axis Double IPA, Vantage Cold IPA, and Snowblind Belgian-Style IPA. This is in addition to the Thunder Meadows IPA, which is part of the brewery's line-up year-round. Do you think they like hops in Fernie? Next time you swing by, be sure to ask about their current IPA Series beers, as well as any other tasty seasonal offerings they have on tap and in the fridge!

It's a family friendly space with board games available to play and occasional events including music nights, special beer releases, and pretty much any good reason to throw a party. Many of the beers are packaged in cans or bottles, as well — a good thing since it would be folly to try to sample every tap in a single visit. Foamers' Folly might just be the most unusual name of a brewery anywhere. Here's the story behind its origin: a “foamer” is apparently a person who is absolutely obsessed with trains. The brewery is located close to some busy train tracks. Connect that to the “foam” on the top of a beer and add the concept of “folly” as a sense of adventure and unique exploration. Tucked between the Golden Ears Mountains and the Fraser River, Maple Ridge is a scenic, forested community with a remarkable natural beauty — and a bounty of craft breweries."

The Zephyrus Series, named after the Greek god of the west wind, is a series of bold and unique ales inspired by the hop-heavy brews of our native West Coast.

It offers the same food and beer so you can sample and nibble while trying for a perfect game. There is a seasonal league for more serious bowlers, and special events for the rest of us. During “Cosmic Bowling” they turn down the lights and turn up the fun with black lights, lasers, and music. According to Wikipedia, five-pin bowling is unique to Canada. Dating back to 1909, it uses the same alley as ten-pin bowling, but is played with a smaller ball without finger holes that can be held in the palm of one hand, which makes it easier for children to play. Five smaller pins are configured in a V-shaped pattern. The centre pin is worth five points if knocked down, those on either side three each, and the outermost pins two each, making each frame worth 15 in total. A perfect game totals 450.

Founded by a beer lover who could not drink conventional beer any more after being diagnosed with Celiac's disease, Grey Fox is the Okanagan's only gluten-free brewery. Brewer Chris Neufeld spent years experimenting with making gluten-free beer at home, but was often disappointed by the results until he learned the science behind unlocking the starches in gluten-free grains like millet and rice. After that, his friends couldn't tell the difference between his GF beer and the conventional beer they drank, which gave him and his wife Suzanne the encouragement they needed to build this brewery. While some conventional breweries produce gluten-reduced beers with barley and wheat by using special enzymes that eliminate most of the gluten in the finished product, true gluten-free beer can only be brewed in a dedicated facility where glutenous ingredients are never even allowed in the building. That is the case at Grey Fox Brewing. Grey Fox is located in Lake Country on the north side of Kelowna.

House of Funk Brewing,"350 E Esplanade, North Vancouver, BC V7L 1A41",49.3078217,-123.0711662,"If you like a little funk in your beer, you've come to the right place.","House of Funk Brewing was created to challenge the status quo of beer, cultivating an environment of experimentation through its ever-changing beer lineup. Every brew spends time fermenting or conditioning in wood, or is subjected to an onslaught of wild yeast, souring bacteria and other funky micro-organisms. The brewery uses a small batch system along with several oak foeders — big wooden vessels that add an oaky character to the beer and also provide a home for bacteria and yeast that add funky, fruity and sour flavours and aromas to the beer. For many beer appreciators, funk is an acquired taste, but once you've acquired a liking for it, you can't get enough of it. Part of the burgeoning Shipyards Brewery District just a few steps away from Beere Brewing, House of Funk is an ideal spot to explore diversity and creativity in beer. The tasting room also features baked goods to go along with its own house-roasted coffee — which is occasionally used as an ingredient in beer recipes, too. What is “funky beer” exactly? This descriptor is hard to pin down, but basically it is used to describe beers that exhibit “wild” or unusual flavours and aromas that are generated through the use of Brettanomyces yeast or bacteria such as Lactobacillus in the brewing process. The results are “barnyard” or (more generously) “farmhouse” flavour/aroma compounds that can add multiple dimensions of character. The longer the beer spends fermenting on wood (in barrels or foeders) with these microbes, the more these funky flavours evolve and develop, making many of these beers ideal for cellaring. There's an après beer for everyone in the big city's outdoor playground. This is where the metropolis meets BC's mighty outdoors."

The brewery also operates a restaurant next to the pub, as well as the Howe Sound Inn, making it an ideal base camp for enjoying all that Squamish has to offer. Howe Sound's Troller Bay Ale is a contemporary re-creation of the first craft beer brewed in Canada at the Horseshoe Bay Brewery in 1982. That beer was brewed by Frank Appleton and John Mitchell to be served in the Troller Pub, which Mitchell managed. Mitchell went on to help build Spinnakers, Canada's first brewpub, in Victoria in 1984, and later helped design Howe Sound's brewery. For more on these BC craft beer pioneers see the BC Ale Trail blog. The Sea to Sky Ale Trail is where mountains meet the ocean, and craft beer brings adventurers together in Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton and Lillooet."
Hoyne Brewing,"2740 Bridge St, Victoria, BC V8T 5C5",48.4371039,-123.373611,A community-focused brewery built on the legacy of its popular founder.,"Hoyne's Growler Station & Retail Store is open Tuesday to Saturday from 11 am – 6 pm. After earning a strong reputation while brewing at two local brewpubs for more than 20 years, Sean Hoyne struck out on his own with this family-run brewery in 2011. Located in the Rock Bay brewery district next door to Driftwood Brewery and close to a few other breweries and brewpubs, Hoyne Brewing has built on its founder's legacy to establish itself a community leader and a fan favourite among many local beer drinkers. The brewery has grown substantially since 2011, expanding the range of beers it produces considerably. Hoyne's beers are always excellent examples of their styles, brewed with high quality ingredients, including malts sourced from traditional regions to reflect the type of beer, such as the UK, Germany and the Czech Republic. There's no better way to make a beer taste authentic than to use the ingredients and methods that made that beer style famous in the first place. The brewery is also committed to sustainable practices, including working with local farmers and suppliers, utilizing a zero-emissions delivery service, and building slowly and steadily, keeping the long term in mind rather than chasing fads. That way, we can be sure that Hoyne's beers will keep tasting great for many years to come. Sean Hoyne was a graduate student in English Literature at the University of Victoria when Swans Brewpub opened in 1989. He applied for the position of brewmaster there and won the job after bringing a six-pack of his home brew to the job interview. After being mentored by BC craft beer pioneer Frank Appleton, who had built Swans, Hoyne moved to the Canoe Brewpub when it opened in 1996 and then struck out on his own in 2011.

Ile Sauvage Brewing,"2960 Bridge Street, Victoria, BC V8T 4T3",48.4401257,-123.3738729,Wild and sour beer on Vancouver Island.,"Co-owner and brewmaster Stephane Turcotte learned his craft by managing a craft beer bar and then opening a brewpub in Busan, South Korea, which he ran for three years. When he decided to move back home to Victoria with his young family, he teamed up with two friends — they were all roommates at the University of Victoria — to open Île Sauvage Brewing in the Rock Bay brewery district, not far from Hoyne Brewing and Driftwood Brewery. The brewery was instantly successful; soon after opening, it was named Rookie Brewery of the Year at the BC Beer Awards. Île Sauvage translates to “wild island,” which is a nod to both its home on this wild island on the west coast of Canada, as well as Turcotte's approach to brewing. Indeed, it's safe to expect a high level of sophistication and complexity in the beers you'll taste here. The lineup always includes a range of sours, saisons and hazy ales, as well as any styles that are new and cutting edge. But don't be intimidated if you don't think of yourself as a “beer geek” — the friendly tasting room staff will be happy to help you explore the beer menu and discover your new favourites. The brewery's stylish, two-level tasting room occupies half of the building, with the brewing equipment, fermentation tanks and barrels right there to ponder as you sip and savour the delicious beers. As British Columbia's only Advanced Cicerone?, Turcotte often hosts educational events at the brewery, including food-and-beer pairing seminars that are both informative and delicious.

Jackknife Brewing,"727 Baillie Ave, Kelowna, BC",49.8963451,-119.4881282,Weird beer and classic pizza with a heavy metal twist.,"Jackknife's founder, Brad Tomlinson, is a local brewer who is proud of his roots in the region. He loves to work with local farmers and producers with the goal of bringing Okanagan terroir into focus through his beers — often incorporating wine grapes or grape must to make hybrid “grape ales.” His approach is best described in his own words: Jackknife is the swirling cauldron of creative locals. We're the ones ripping through forests and shredding in hazy garages. Our wizards and witches meld local lore and elements with favourite pieces of Nordic brewing history while worshiping at the altar of the sacred unholy circle, zza. You can only find our beer in our dungeon so swing on down and slay a slice and murder a beer with us! The delicious results can be unapologetically weird, but one thing that is decidedly not weird is Jackknife's handmade pizzas, which might very well be the best in the Okanagan. Make sure to stop in on a Sunday when they serve up Detroit-style deep-dish square pan pizza. Jackknife Brewing brews all their beer with Norwegian kveik yeasts. The centuries-old strains were cultivated by Nordic farmhouse brewers and are known for their vigorous fermentation and unique flavours.

First, there is the name itself — which translates into “The Shipyards Brewery” — along with the eye-catching white-and-blue tiles accenting the whitewashed walls. Most of the super friendly staff hail from Spanish-speaking countries so you'll likely hear them chatting in Spanish while they work. The kitchen serves up delicious tacos and most of the beers have a Mexican tinge. Spanish music is always playing, including a guitarist who performs live every Thursday evening. In other words, visiting this cerveceria will make you feel like you are in Mexico. Most of the beers are light and approachable with a Mexican twist. The Salted Lime Lager is the most popular, while others feature tropical ingredients like mangos, limes and coconuts prominently. In the winter season, look for the unique Acan Chufa Horchata Porter. La Cerveceria Astilleros was founded by a Canadian who grew up living in Latin American countries and speaks Spanish fluently himself. The brewery has a sister winery above it called Garden of Granite. There's an après beer for everyone in the big city's outdoor playground. This is where the metropolis meets BC's mighty outdoors."

During many road trips to basketball tournaments with their own kids and the other kids they coached, they enjoyed many conversations and kindled a shared passion for craft beer. Over time, a plan to build this brewery came together. Located near the town of Winfield in Lake Country just north of Kelowna, the brewery is a venue where folks can come together to have a good time.

Lighthouse Brewing,"836 Devonshire Rd, Victoria, BC V9A 4T4",48.436429,-123.3965167,Ahoy matey! Esquimalt's own craft brewery reflects its nautical heritage.,"Founded in 1998, Lighthouse's beers and marketing have always reflected a nautical theme. This makes good sense based on its location in Esquimalt, home to Canada's Pacific Coast naval base. That location used to set the brewery apart somewhat from the rest of the breweries in Victoria, which form a ring around the Upper Harbour, but the addition of a tasting room and picnic area at the brewery, as well as the opening of Driftwood Brewing's new location nearby, have definitely made it into a destination worth checking out. If you're a cyclist you'll be thrilled to hear the brewery is located right next to the E&N Rail Trail, which connects downtown Victoria with the Galloping Goose Trail near View Royal.

Based on a 96-acre farm that has been owned and operated by the MacInnes family for generations, this brewery offers the unique opportunity to taste beer brewed with ingredients grown and processed on-site. The MacInnes farm grows all the barley and most of the hops that go into the beer, along with other ingredients like wheat, rye, berries, and honey that are used in certain recipes. The farm also malts its own barley, which means Locality controls virtually every aspect of producing its beer from planting the seeds to pouring it into the glass for you. The brewery is based in a converted barn where patrons are welcome to get beer and snacks and then take them outside to enjoy in a picnic area. Tours of the brewery, malt house, and farm are also offered. It's a beautiful spot to visit, with a small lake and a picturesque barley field and hop yard to serve as backdrops for your Instagram posts.

Longwood Brew Pub & Restaurant,"5775 Turner Rd, Nanaimo, BC V9T 6L8",49.2245464,-124.035322,Nanaimo's original craft brewery and one of BC's most welcoming brewpubs.,"The Longwood Brewpub has anchored the Longwood Station plaza in the north end of Nanaimo since 1999. It has a family-friendly restaurant upstairs and a pub downstairs, with a big fieldstone fireplace to warm a body up on a cold, wet Vancouver Island winter day. The bar has four English-style draught engines serving cellar-conditioned beer to go along with excellent food from the kitchen. The growler movement in BC started at the Longwood Brewpub. Although the half-gallon, take-away jugs did not become ubiquitous in British Columbia until 2012 or so, Longwood was the brewery that first suggested the concept to the liquor board. Community craft breweries abound from Cowichan's warm climate and agricultural heritage, leading through Duncan and Chemainus to Nanaimo's urban, maritime vibe and Ladysmith."

Featuring a line-up of 6 core beers ranging from a Continental Pilsner to an Imperial Stout and 4 rotating seasonal beers, there is something for everyone at the growler bar. With a focus on being “small farm friendly”, Longwood Brewery on Boxwood Road partners with many local farmers for a wide range of ingredients, resulting in an obsessively local product. In fact, the majority of all the barley and hops Longwood Brewery uses is sourced within BC. Gift cards available for sale in the taproom In 2020, The Tyee Magazine named Longwood Brewery “the standout in 100-mile brewing in BC”. “Longwood describes itself as obsessively local and at any given time will have several entirely local beers available.

LoveShack Libations,"4134 Island Hwy W #1, Qualicum Beach, BC V9K 2B2",49.363983,-124.521094,This small Qualicum Beach brewery is a labour of love.,"When Dave and Rachel Paul first moved to Qualicum Beach from Pemberton, near Whistler, they lived in a small home Dave built, which they affectionately dubbed the “Love Shack.” Later, after building a larger house, the shack became his hobby brewery. But after repeated encouragement from Rachel, Dave decided to turn his hobby into this small brewery located right on the Island Highway. What you'll find at this nano brewery today is resonant with that small home; you'll find a place of comfort, gathering, and joy, of friends old and new, and of really, really good beer. In late 2024 the brewery underwent an exciting transition: longtime friends and LoveShack fans Jayce Hawkins and Chris Barton took over the brewery, with the intention of continuing Dave's incredible legacy of good times and delicious beers. They continue to brew Dave's well-loved mainstay recipes while also adding a few new creations into the mix. You can also listen to this Cascadian Beer Podcast episode featuring LoveShack Libations.

Luppolo Brewing Company,"1123 Venables St, Vancouver, BC V6A 2C6",49.2769121,-123.0805868,Enjoy Italian-inspired craft beer and food in East Vancouver.,"New in-house food partner Local Pizzaiolo provides delicious Italian pizza and snacks - now available on Uber Eats! Vancouver's East Side has a long historical connection with Italian culture: restaurants and cafés, delis, gelaterias, pizzerias, and — thanks to this brewery — craft beer! Luppolo (pronounced loop-o-lo) is Italian for “hops,” one of the core ingredients in beer. The brewery chose this name to reflect the Italian heritage of two of its owners and to embrace the concepts of craftsmanship, community and family, values they feel are closely associated with Italian culture. The brewery's branding is both elegant and playful, and the tasting room's decor is attractive and welcoming. Luppolo's approach to brewing embraces a mix of old world and contemporary craft styles, often with a bit of an Italian twist, like the Tart Wild Ale brewed with heaps of Italian prune plums. The brewery's own kitchen offers a variety of Italian aperitivo (appetizers), including a selection of Italian cured meats and cheeses, antipasti, salads and focaccia. Luppolo has also partnered with Mordimi, an authentic Italian pizzeria that now operates at the brewery, so you can get fantastic pizza there, too. A patio was added during the pandemic, allowing for patrons to be served outside. Luppolo is also a partner in BeerVan, a collective of small family-owned Vancouver craft breweries and beverage producers working together to deliver their products locally. You can also do Take Out – walk in, call in, or order online  (pizza and beer). Is there such a thing as Italian craft beer? The answer is yes, sort of. While Italy is well known for its wine culture, craft beer has been on the upswing there over the past two decades. Italian brewers created a wine-beer hybrid called Italian Grape Ale that is now being brewed around the world, including here in BC. Italian Pilsners incorporate more dry-hopping than the traditional German/Czech lagers they are based on. Apparently, some Italian craft breweries have even experimented with beers brewed with tomatoes and basil, but maybe those ingredients are best left in sauces! One of the most cosmopolitan cities on the continent, bordered by sea, forest and mountain peaks: Vancouver really has it all."
Main Street Brewing,"261 E 7th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5T 0B4",49.2647835,-123.0993079,Draught and casks in a beautiful heritage building.,"Expanding the brewhouse has always been a nerve-shredding experience for the staff at Main St. Brewing. That's because the only way to get new tanks into this heritage industrial building is lowering them by crane through one of the large skylights. Thankfully, visitors need only worry about what they're going to sample from the extensive beer list here, which includes five core brands (pilsner, pale ale, IPA, saison and brown ale), several interesting seasonals, and up to four cask ales that are hand pumped in the old-fashioned way. Adding to this plethora of choice is the Garage Series, which is named after the building's origins as the Vancouver Breweries' Garage — an ongoing collection of wild-fermented and barrel-aged beer driven by brewmaster Azlan Graves' curiousity. The lounge occupies one corner of the building but is very much part of the brewery as a whole, with the sounds of the brewhouse and the sweet smell of spent grain occasionally wafting through. It's a beautiful space, featuring exposed brick, large murals, strings of bulbs stretched between sturdy beams and long tables ideal for sharing stories or swapping beer opinions. The food menu, which ranges from excellent tacos to a charcuterie board, is also well worth a try. The historic building housing Main Street Brewing was built in 1913 as part of the Vancouver Brewery complex, which was located at 6th and Main. It is one of the few remaining remnants of a number of breweries that operated in the “Brewery Creek” neighbourhood, so-named because of the stream that ran from Tea Swamp (roughly Main and 15th) down to False Creek, which then extended past Main all the way Clark Drive. Most of Vancouver's original breweries were built here, including the City and Mainland breweries (both founded in 1887) and the Columbia Brewery (1888). Many of the breweries were built along the stream, utilizing the water for brewing as well as to power their equipment, including: Alexander Brewery (6th and Scotia); Doering and Marstrand (7th and Scotia); and the San Francisco Brewery (11th and Main). Look for the historical plaque describing Brewery Creek near Main and Kingsway.

Michael worked part-time for years selling Okanagan wines to restaurants in Vancouver and Whistler while home brewing in his spare time. Annette, meanwhile, was a home-based artist and mother to their two children. Eventually, they decided that Michael should turn his hobby into a side business so they converted her studio into a brewery. All of the labels and merchandise are designed by Annette and their kids help out with bottling and other duties as needed. In 2020, Michael left his wine sales job to work at the brewery full-time, which allowed them to expand their tasting to four days a week (Thursdays through Sundays from 1-5pm). Michael loves to incorporate local ingredients in his beers, especially in the Forager Saison, which features locally harvested ingredients that change throughout the year, including salal berries, stinging nettles, dandelion and burdock, rose hips, rose petals, rock weed, bull kelp, sea asparagus, and grand fir tips, just to name a few!

The small city overlooks the picturesque Peace River and offers a diverse mix of urban and rural adventure that will satisfy any visitor. Mighty Peace Brewing was founded by four local friends who were inspired by the array of craft breweries opening across British Columbia and wanted to share their love of beer with the local community. Locals who fill up the taproom and patio every day seem to have embraced that journey themselves — the brewer says the top selling beer has been the light and refreshing Peace Gold, but lately the hoppier ISA is challenging it for top spot, and the stronger IPA is gaining traction, too. The Peace Country is well known for its abundant agriculture, and Mighty Peace loves to experiment by incorporating local fruit in the beer recipes — literally whatever is in season locally, including haskap berries, currants, honey and cherries. And local consumers love that connection: whenever people find out that a local farmer's fruit is in the beer, they rush in to get some, and it disappears quickly. There is a local connection on the food side of things at Mighty Peace, too: the Mighty Brewery Board features sausages and cured meats from a local farm. Fort St. John is the oldest non-aboriginal settlement in British Columbia dating back to 1794. It began as Rocky Mountain Fort, a trading post that was established one year after Alexander Mackenzie first explored the area in 1793. It is the largest city in the BC half of the Peace Region. Prepare to be awed by the vast geography of rugged mountains, pristine lakes and rolling prairies found alongside the craft breweries of Fort St John, Dawson Creek, Quesnel, Williams Lake and Valemount."
Mile Zero Brewing,"4495 Happy Valley Road, Metchosin, BC V9C 3Z3",48.3803571,-123.5319573,Description title not found,"Located in Metchosin about halfway between Sooke and Victoria, this small brewery has a strong connection with its local community. It is based in a building that previously was the local school — residents often muse about how the tasting room used to be their classroom while sipping on the beer and enjoying a range of delicious bites. Mile Zero was founded by Michelle and Michael Morgan who conceived of the idea to open a brewery and then teamed up with their friend Dirk. The “nanobrewery” setup has a very small capacity so the brewery doesn't package or distribute its beer beyond the brewery, but it has a welcoming tasting room and a sunny patio where customers can enjoy the range of beers. The food menu features creations by Urban Forage, a Victoria-based cafe and catering company, including pizza, shepherd's pie, sausage rolls, mac and cheese, and delicious pretzels, along with other treats. Also, watch for pop-up pizza sessions and other food events featuring treats by local caterers and food trucks. Longer-ranging cyclists will be pleased to know this brewery is located almost exactly halfway between Victoria and Sooke, offering an ideal “refreshment stop” for those who choose to make that trip or just want to do a long loop ride out from either end of the Galloping Goose Regional Trail. Greater Victoria is home to Canada's first brewpub and some of British Columbia's most popular breweries. Venture beyond — visit nearby Sooke or hop a ferry to explore the Southern Gulf Islands.

• uncommon combinations of ingredients & flavours you can't find anywhere else
• collaborations with artists & brands that help us offer exciting new experiences
• the collective of brewers who inspire us to push boundaries & break the rules Drop by for taste in the welcoming tasting room or the picnic patio out front of the brewery. ?? Gift cards available for sale in the Tasting Room. Despite the name, Moody Ales does make lager — a Vienna Lager created by one of their brewers, Robyn, who likes to pair it with German bratwurst. Sho, another Moody Ales brewer, prefers it with Mexican carnitas. This actually makes sense because the style originated in Vienna in the 1800s and later became popular in Mexico thanks to Austrian emigrant brewers. It's a malt-forward, clean lager that obviously pairs well with pork. With multiple unique breweries on Brewers Row, beer lovers agree that Port Moody is anything but sleepy—it's a craft beer destination."

Mountainview Brewing,"390 Old Hope Princeton Way, Hope, BC V0X 1L0",49.3749552,-121.4352575,Let's meet up for a beer in Hope.,"Hope, BC, is a meeting place. It sits at the confluence of the Fraser and Coquihalla Rivers, and marks the eastern boundary of the Fraser Valley. It is where the Coquihalla and Crowsnest Highways split off from the Trans-Canada, which makes it a place many people drive through, often stopping there for a rest break to stretch their legs and maybe get a bite to eat. As such, it was always quite surprising that Hope was also one of the few places in BC that didn't have a brewery of its own. That changed when Mountainview Brewing finally opened. The owners, Adam and Danielle Keil, grew up in Hope but moved to the Lower Mainland for work. They saw the potential for a brewery in Hope with so many tourists driving through along with the untapped local market. For the brewery's location they picked a large building that had previously held a machine shop because it would provide lots of space. Renovations took a long time, and when Mountainview finally opened, they faced unexpected challenges as one of the first new breweries to open during the COVID pandemic, but they have adapted and kept the beer flowing. Mountainview has a large, airy tasting room with a view of the brewery. The kitchen offers sandwiches, salads and other snacks to go along with the delicious range of beers. Check it out the next time you are driving through Hope, or better yet, plan a getaway just to visit the brewery and all the local attractions, including hiking trails and a variety of local parks. First Blood, the original Rambo movie, was filmed in and around Hope. Fans can take a self-guided tour of filming locations used in the movie. One of Mountainview's most popular beers is its First Blood Orange, an imperial wheat beer that “packs a punch worthy of Sylvester Stallone himself.” The cities of Abbotsford, Chilliwack and Hope offer a mix of relaxing countryside, urban culture, and rugged backcountry beauty. Their hop growing history is reflected in diverse craft breweries."
Mt. Begbie Brewing,"2155 Oak Drive, Revelstoke, BC V0E 2S1",50.9952727,-118.1652183,Experience craft beer amid the rugged beauty of mountainous Revelstoke.,"This brewery grew out of a casual honeymoon conversation between founders Bart and Tracey Larson: “Hey, maybe we should open a brewery?” The original idea grew until they found themselves opening a brewery in Bart's hometown of Revelstoke. More than two decades later, the couple has grown Mt. Begbie to the point that it now ships beer throughout BC. To celebrate their company's 20th birthday, the Larsons built a big, new brewery on a 10-acre piece of land just off the Trans-Canada Highway near downtown Revelstoke. The new facility has a larger retail shop, dedicated tasting room, commercial kitchen, and, of course, increased capacity on the production side. In 2021, Mt. Begbie Brewing celebrated its 25th Anniversary.  Bart Larson, who is Mt. Begbie's brewmaster as well as co-founder, has a PhD in nuclear physics, but he gave up that career to “make beer, not war.” Up until recently, he was likely the most educated brewer in BC, but he now shares that distinction with Category 12 Brewing's Michael Kuzyk, who has a PhD in microbiology and biochemistry. Spectacular parks, hot springs and hiking trails, as well as several alpine resorts make the towns of Creston, Fernie, Cranbrook, Invermere, Kimberley, Radium Hot Springs, Golden and Revelstoke a Utopia for wilderness explorers and craft beer lovers."

Look closely and you will see that the bench seating around the outer edge is actually the original pool's rim.

Persephone Brewing,"1053 Stewart Rd, Gibsons, BC V0N 1V7",49.4207588,-123.5082391,Explore the Beer Farm.,"In 2017 Persephone became the first brewery in BC to be certified as a B-Corp. This means it is a business that meets the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. Persephone is easy to spot: just look for the tall rows of hops planted in front of the big red barn right next to the highway on the way into Gibsons. In the summer, the hop bines will grow up to 10 metres (30 feet) high. After harvest in the late summer, those hops are dried and processed so that they can be used in batches of Persephone's beer throughout the year, along with barley that is grown and malted in BC. Persephone's local focus extends beyond ingredients: The Beer Farm also has a partnership with a local Community Living organization to employ disabled adults, and leases out space on its land for vegetable production. There are also beehives and chicken coops, along with an Airstream trailer turned food truck parked right beside the brewery.

The show featured a cast of characters centred around Nick Adonidas, a Greek-Canadian log salvager played by Bruno Gerussi, and “Relic,” his dastardly rival who was played by Robert Clothier. The brewery originally planned on calling itself Beachcomber Brewing, but faced a trademark challenge from another brewery. It switched to Persephone, which was the name of Nick's boat in the show. In Greek mythology, Persephone is the goddess of the underworld, married to Hades, but is also associated with spring and the fertility of vegetation—very appropriate for a farm-based brewery. This is the West Coast beyond compare. On BC's southwest coast lies a hidden paradise of coastal geography awaiting discovery — along with some of the province's most distinctive breweries in Gibsons, Sechelt and Powell River."

Undeterred, he maxed out all the credit cards he could get his hands and started it that way. At first. he did everything himself — brewing, packaging, delivering — and even slept at the brewery. Since then, Phillips has grown into what is arguably the biggest success story in BC craft beer history. This “Legend of Matt Phillips” is all true, and the best thing about it is that the brewery's success is all based on great beer that is consistently well brewed without cutting any corners. Phillips' place within the community is cemented through its creative relationship with music events like Rifflandia Festival and its own Phillips Backyard Weekender which draw thousands of music-loving, craft beer consuming attendees every summer. Phillips opened its own maltworks behind the brewery in 2015. The facility malts barley and wheat from local Vancouver Island farmers, giving the brewery ultimate control over the core grains being used in its beers and distilled products.

Powell Brewery,"1357 Powell St, Vancouver, BC V5L 1G8",49.2833773,-123.0757617,This Powell Street brewery is a success story that just keeps getting better and better.,"Watch for special pop-up barbecue events held throughout the year at Powell Brewery. When husband and wife David Bowkett and Nicole Stefanopoulos opened their nanobrewery in late 2012, they planned for slow, steady growth. Within six months, that plan was shredded when Powell Street Craft Brewery's Old Jalopy Pale Ale won beer of the year at the Canadian Brewing Awards. As demand spiked, Bowkett simply could not brew enough beer. The only option was to move — and, thankfully for the brand, a larger space opened up a few blocks west on Powell Street. Almost in direct contrast to its origins, Powell Brewery (the name was tweaked in 2016) has a luxurious amount of space, with ample room for Bowkett's burgeoning barrel-aging program and a walk-in cooler the size of the original brewery. Bowkett and his brewing team focus on classic styles and more experimental creations featuring new hop varietals and souring. Powell has also expanded its repertoire with a line of low-calorie beer seltzers called SLTZR (pronounced Seltzer) that pour clear and bubbly, gluten-free, and vegan,  as well the Light series featuring beers that are low in calories, but still big in flavour. Bowkett's other great passion is barbecue — he is the founder of Aftermath Barbecue, a Texas-influenced BBQ pop-up company that holds regular cooks in the Powell Brewery parking lot, where you will also find a large patio space to augment the indoor tasting room.

RAD Brewing,"Unit 11, 215 Port Augusta St, Comox, BC V9M 3M9",49.6734219,-124.924513,A new tradition starts in Comox.,"It seems as if the name of this brewery picked itself. After New Tradition Brewing unfortunately had to close, the co-owners of the Church St Taphouse decided to buy the brewery and restart it. As they were taking down the letter signs on the front facade one by one, RAD Brewing appeared. At first they kept it just for fun, but quickly they realized this was a way to draw a connection to the past while refreshing the business under new ownership. Part of that renewal was a renovation of the tasting room to add a kitchen and updating and enlarging the patio space. Expect good food, including street-style tacos, along with the high quality lineup of beer brewed on site. These folks know what the local consumer likes when it comes to be — after all, they have been running the nearby Church St Taphouse for a few years already — so you can be sure to find something rad on tap. Experience craft beer culture interwoven with natural beauty, agricultural splendour and some of BC's most spectacular beaches in Parksville Qualicum Beach, Port Alberni, Ucluelet, Tofino, the Comox Valley, Campbell River, Port McNeill and beyond."

Radium Brewing is also an environmentally progressive business that is based in a net-zero building with solar panels on the roof and a brewing system that stores and reuses heat from one batch to the next. Eventually they hope to expand their solar system to the point where the beer can be brewed using nothing but solar power. Although the brewery doesn't have a kitchen, customers are encouraged to bring in food from one of the local restaurants to go along with the beer. Spectacular parks, hot springs and hiking trails, as well as several alpine resorts make the towns of Creston, Fernie, Cranbrook, Invermere, Kimberley, Radium Hot Springs, Golden and Revelstoke a Utopia for wilderness explorers and craft beer lovers."

Ravens Brewing Company,"37455 Kilgard Road, Abbotsford, BC V3G 0H8",49.055287,-122.18732,NOTE: Ravens Brewing's tasting room is currently under construction. The onsite store is open for beer pickups only.,"Respect for craft beer and the ingredients that go into it is the focus at this Abbotsford brewery. Ravens produces a mix of European and West Coast beers that often hold a strong connection to the community's agricultural roots by including local ingredients such as berries, rhubarb, cherries, and herbs. The brewery has won multiple awards, including a Gold Medal at the 2018 World Beer Cup for its Corvus Lingonberry Lime Gose. Proud of its place in the community and its heritage as an aboriginal-owned company, Ravens has formed many partnerships with local suppliers and producers to source coffee, tea, and chocolate for specialty beers. It also supports local arts and culture groups as well as sports programs and charities.  In 2018, Ravens won a gold medal at the prestigious World Beer Cup for its Corvus Lingonberry Lime Gose, a delicately flavoured and attractive beer that wins over everyone who tries it. A Gose is an unusual German wheat beer that is slightly sour and salty. For Corvus, Ravens blends tart, red lingonberries with lime and pink Himalayan salt to complement the acidity already present in the beer. The cities of Abbotsford, Chilliwack and Hope offer a mix of relaxing countryside, urban culture, and rugged backcountry beauty. Their hop growing history is reflected in diverse craft breweries."
R&B Brewing,"54 E 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5T 1E8",49.2671457,-123.1034109,Brewing in East Van before brewing in East Van was cool.,"Clearly proud of its roots, R&B has been a self-described “East Van Original” since 1997, when it was opened by Rick Dellow (R) and Barry Benson (B). The east side of the city was grittier and far less developed then, but Benson and Dellow found a loyal local following and later became granddaddies to the beer scene bubbling up around their Mount Pleasant location. R&B was bought by Howe Sound Brewing in 2015 and a consequent injection of funds has given it a fresh lease on life, including a cozy, retro-styled restaurant full of trinkets, ornate lighting, vintage speakers, and thirsty staff from Hootsuite's nearby headquarters. The kitchen specializes in attractively priced personal pizzas and enticing bar snacks including pretzels, kettle chips, and olives. The brewery, meanwhile, holds fast to its heritage with classic, multiple-award-winning brews like Raven Cream Ale and Vancouver Special IPA, while branching out into more daring styles like their award-winning Dill Pickle Gose. The cask beer movement was a major part of Vancouver's craft beer renaissance during the 2000s  — and R&B Brewing was one of the first breweries to provide cask-conditioned beer to local restaurants on a regular basis. Indeed, co-founder Barry Benson remembers tapping a cask of Auld Nick Winter Ale in 1998 at the old Fogg n' Suds restaurant  on West Broadway, an early haven for Vancouver beer lovers. Later, R&B helped develop a regular weekly cask event called Real Ale Sundays at The Whip restaurant (6th off Main), which now is virtually surrounded by breweries  — with Brassneck just around the corner and Main St. Brewing a block away. Today, cask beers proliferate throughout BC's breweries and tap houses, largely because of R&B's pioneer efforts. From the Downtown brewpubs to Kitsilano and Mount Pleasant's diverse range of small, local breweries, there is a beer and brewery for every taste on the Brewery Creek Vancouver Ale Trail."

After some time away spent travelling with his family in a converted bus, he got back into the brewing game by opening the Noble Pig Brewhouse, a food-focused brewpub, and consulting on some other brewery start-ups before deciding to open this place. Red Collar has a big 80-seat tasting room along with an outdoor patio space, and the beer list is diverse and interesting. Recently, he has started taking a step back from day-to-day operations, handing the reins to a new head brewer and his daughter Lara, who manages the business side of the company. While studying brewing in Munich, Germany, in the 1980s, David Beardsell visited a Trappist brewery in Belgium where he befriended two of the monks, Father Theodore and Father Charles. They got along so well they even gave him some of the monastery's proprietary yeast, which Beardsell eventually brought home to Kamloops and put in cryo-storage at the local university. He uses it to brew Belgian-style beers to this day, including Red Collar's Dubbel, Tripel and Quad.

When he felt it was time for his Red Truck Beer Company to expand, he relocated it from North Vancouver and financed a brewery from the ground up; and to celebrate breaking ground at the Brewery Creek site, a red truck was dropped from a crane. Opened in 2015, the 34,000-square-foot brewery is a shiny marvel, with rows of towering tanks, state-of-the-art bottling and canning lines, and another red truck suspended from the ceiling. You can see it all through the back windows of the Truck Stop Diner, which offers a large menu of homely comfort food, from stacked sandwiches and burgers to deluxe hot dogs and tacos. After focusing on a lager and an amber ale for most of its existence, Red Truck has steadily expanded its portfolio under head brewer Justin Vickaryous since it moved. Taking up premium parking space outside the brewery is “Old Weird Harold,” the 1946 Dodge pickup that gave its name to the brewery. In the summer, the brewery also hosts an outdoor concert series in its parking lot.

This place is all about nostalgia for those of us of a certain age who lived through MuchMusic, Ferris Bueller, Alf, and The Goonies. If you knew your way around VCR time-shifting your favourite shows on VHS tapes and listening to mixed tapes on a Sony Walkman, then this place is definitely for you!

A recent revitalization is making it even more attractive and enticing to visit as part of an Island getaway. The brewery is based in a converted barn nestled at the base of Mount Bruce, and sources its water from a spring located on the mountainside above the facility — an ideal setup since fresh water can be a scarce commodity on the Southern Gulf Islands. It has a small tasting room upstairs in what was likely a hay loft originally, with several outdoor seating areas nestled among the surrounding trees. The original brewing equipment is in the process of being upgraded, and there are also plans to add a secondary building to house either a tasting room or perhaps a traditional Belgian-style coolship, which would allow for the production of spontaneously fermented beers using yeast and bacteria from the air. Those beers would truly live up to the brewery's motto: “Drink Beer With Nature.” Greater Victoria is home to Canada's first brewpub and some of British Columbia's most popular breweries.

At the helm of the brewery is a respected local veteran, Dave Varga, who established himself at Red Truck Beer Co. and 33 Acres Brewing before joining up with two business partners who have been best friends since high school.

The Munich Lager, Sherwood's take on the classic dunkel, is a big hit with balanced notes of caramel and roast malt. The brewery's new patio has likewise proven to be a big hit—owing to its inland location, Terrace gets just a fraction of the rainfall nearby coastal areas receive, and a heck of a lot more sunshine, too. There is no actual Sherwood Mountain; the name refers to owner Darryl Tucker, aka Friar Tuck himself.

Shore Line Brewing was a long time coming, but well worth the wait. Its owners, a husband and wife team, conceived of the idea for the brewery back when there were only two breweries in Kelowna. They incorporated the company in 2016 and signed an agreement to be part of The Shore development project in 2017 before it was built. Construction delays meant it was late 2019 before the brewery equipment could be set up in the space, but when they were finally ready to open the brewery, the pandemic arrived to delay their plans even further. In the end, Shore Line opened in May, 2020, one of only two breweries in the Mission district south of downtown Kelowna. The brewery's large capacity means it can serve locals in its tap room or on its outdoor patios, and also distribute packaged beer all the way from Fernie to Vancouver Island. Head Brewer Dylan Stus, who hails from the Prairies originally, worked at Nelson Brewing for a while before joining the team here. He helped set up the brewery equipment and created the beer lineup, which includes classics like lagers and stouts along with cutting edge contemporary styles like sours and hazy IPAs. The brewery's restaurant serves creative comfort food made with fresh local ingredients, including pizzas, tacos, chicken sandwiches, and fish and chips that many customers say is the best they've ever had.

The food menu is diverse and extensive, including specialties like house-smoked chicken and brisket to go along with the excellent beer brewed on site. Back in 1985, Vernon became one of the early epicentres of microbrewing in British Columbia when the Okanagan Spring Brewery opened there. Over the following decade OK Spring expanded its range throughout the province, introducing many communities to “microbrew,” and by the early ‘90s, Okanagan Spring Pale Ale was BC's quintessential craft beer — before we even called it “craft.” Eventually, the operation grew so large that it was bought by Sleeman Breweries of Ontario, which in turn was bought by the Japanese brewery, Sapporo. Because it lost its independence, we don't really call Okanagan Spring a craft brewery anymore, but the big operation is still there in Vernon, employing many locals and churning out a lot of beer.

Smugglers Trail Caskworks,"140 - 9339 200A St, Langley, BC V1M 0B3",49.1719187,-122.6659806,Fine ales for adventurous folk in historic Langley,"According to local legend, smugglers and miners once travelled along a trail that ran through present-day Langley to avoid British tax collectors during the Gold Rush. The adventurers who blazed this trail were resourceful risk-takers, a trait shared by the two founders of this brewery. Stephen and Jamie are longtime rugby teammates and friends who set their sights on opening Langley's second brewery several years ago, back when only Trading Post Brewing had opened there. It took them a bit longer than they hoped to achieve their goal — as of its opening, Smugglers' Trail is Langley's sixth brewery and counting — but their perseverance and hard work paid off. After developing their brand through contract brewing with other breweries for a few years, Smugglers' Trail is now brewing its own beer at its own facility. The brewery boasts an attractive tasting room with a full kitchen serving elevated comfort foods. From a beer perspective, as the name implies, there is a strong connection to the English tradition of cask-conditioned beer: in addition to regular draft lines, the bar also has seven beer engines, giving customers the option of trying some of the beers on cask or on draft. Smugglers' Trail's location just north of the Trans-Canada highway in Langley Township, not far from Dead Frog Brewery, acts as a bridge connecting the other group of Langley City breweries on the south of the highway with the Maple Ridge Ale Trail north of the river. In other words, today's Smugglers Trail might not lead to gold, but it definitely leads to delicious craft beer! Langley is rich in history, urban experiences and fresh craft beer."

Head Brewer John Adair is a dedicated craftsman who worked his way up from the bottling line at a Vancouver brewery to eventually become Head Brewer here. He puts his all into brewing, and his attention to detail pays off in delicious, pitch-perfect beers. While the brewery only packages special barrel-aged beers in bottles occasionally, it offers growler fills and sells some of its beers in cans. Sooke Brewing does not have its own kitchen, but excellent food is available to order from the food truck parked behind the brewery.

Sooke Oceanside Brewery,"5871 - A Sooke Road, Sooke, BC V9Z 0C7",48.393073,-123.659643,Celebrating craft beer in the oceanside community of Sooke.,"Sooke Oceanside Brewery was founded by a chef who loved to make beer in his garage during his downtime. He dreamed of opening a brewery on the waterfront in Sooke. Although S.O.B. started off in a tiny location next to a gas station, he held on to his dream, and finally, just before its fifth anniversary, the brewery moved to a fantastic new location in a custom-built facility with an ocean view. The tasting room is tucked behind a building housing Fuca Cycles and the Seek & Surf shop.

It was Canada's first brewpub when it opened in 1984, so it's a pilgrimage of sorts for beer lovers. But Spinnakers was also an early proponent of the local food movement and its chef continues to work closely with local farmers and food producers today. Of course, the main reason is the beer, including some original recipes dating back more than 30 years, cutting-edge styles such as sours and barrel-aged beers, daily casks, and ciders made on-site. Recently, Spinnakers began distilling its own spirits as well. Spinnakers' own guesthouses even allow you to use it as a home base for exploring Victoria's diverse craft beer community. Before Spinnakers opened, federal excise tax laws forbade brewing and serving beer in the same building. But the folks wanting to open this new “brewpub” went ahead with construction, lobbying the government, half-jokingly insisting that, if necessary, they'd take the beer out one door, drive it around the block and deliver it to the pub through another door. Fortunately, the government changed the laws just in time and Canada's first brewpub opened in May 1984.

The brewpub spreads through several rooms on two levels, allowing you to enjoy a full range of award-winning beers brewed onsite, using traditional steam-powered brewing methods. Make sure to grab a bite while you're there as the restaurant boasts a kitchen that is sure to impress. After operating this location for nearly two decades, Steamworks opened its Burnaby Brewery and Taproom, complete with whirls and twirls that would not be out of place in a Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. You can also visit the Steamworks Mount Pleasant Kitchen & Taphouse, which is nestled among a few of the breweries in the Brewery Creek area near Main and Broadway. The original name for this brewpub was Quarterdeck, but during its construction in 1995, the architects discovered they had access to an underground steam pipe that provides heat to many downtown buildings. The same pipe also helps power the nearby Gastown Steam Clock, which charms tourists with its steam whistle every 15 minutes. They decided to use it to heat the brew kettle and the new name for the brewpub was born. From the Downtown brewpubs to Kitsilano and Mount Pleasant's diverse range of small, local breweries, there is a beer and brewery for every taste on the Brewery Creek Vancouver Ale Trail."

The taproom is open daily for tasting beer at its freshest, directly from the tank to the tap to the glass. The lineup includes Steamworks' signature lineup and a constant rotation of seasonally brewed beers, along with the occasional test tap, too.

Strange Fellows Brewing,"1345 Clark Dr, Vancouver, BC V5L 3K8",49.2725048,-123.0780409,"Inspired by tradition and creativity, celebrating the strange and extraordinary.","Before opening Strange Fellows in 2014, brewer Iain Hill made a name for himself at Yaletown Brewing, where he was head brewer for nearly 20 years. He showed off a talent for conventional styles — his Brick and Beam IPA won Best in Show at the 2010 BC Beer Awards — but he was even more respected for his Oud Bruin, a sour Flemish brown ale, which he began experimenting with following an inspirational trip to Belgium in the 1990s. Since opening Strange Fellows, Hill has expanded his repertoire of both conventional and sour beers considerably. Although the brewery's marketing makes much of the “strange fellows” — Hill and his business partner Aaron Jonckheere — who teamed up on this project, this place is anything but strange; its tasting room and staff are extremely welcoming and the beer is some of the best you'll taste in B.C. Strange Fellows' annual Fellowship program offers beer aficionados with a taste for extraordinary beer the opportunity to gain exclusive access to rare, barrel-aged ales released in small batches four times per year. Fellowship members also receive discounts on regular beers and growler fills, a special t-shirt and an invitation to two private Fellowship events. Being a Strange Fellow certainly has its benefits!

Strathcona Beer Co.,"895 E Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6A 3Y1",49.2812705,-123.0851473,A world-class brewery and pizza kitchen in the heart of Vancouver's oldest neighbourhood.,"This popular brewery is named for the Strathcona neighbourhood, Vancouver's oldest residential area, which is home to families, artists and a variety of light industry and local businesses. When the brewery opened in 2016, its lineup featured mainly traditional European beer styles, but over the next few years the focus shifted towards sours, fruit-forward beers, and IPAs, while keeping its Czech-style Pilsner. Today it is best known for its Beach series of fruity radlers as well as its Love Buzz series of fruity Berliner Weiss-style sours. The brewery occupies a large building with a sizable tasting room that has a modern industrial design, featuring lots of open concrete, white fir bar and table tops, and neon highlighting—a nod to Hastings Street's history of 1950s-era neon signs. It has cozy booths and two long communal tables. An outdoor patio space is also open during the pandemic (weather permitting). Strathcona Beer Co. is also well known for its excellent pizzas, prepared to order on-site. Between the beer and pizza, you certainly can't go wrong. Strathcona Beer Co. acted as the brewing home for Superflux Beer for two years while they were developing their own brewery nearby. That relationship served both companies well. Superflux's expertise with cutting-edge IPAs rubbed off on Strathcona while Strathcona's sour specialty was a positive influence on Superflux. With Superflux's own operation now open less than 10 minutes walking away, fans of both breweries can easily visit both.

In fact, it all began just a few blocks away at Callister Brewing. There, in Callister's incubator, the Superflux concept was first explored. After a year honing their craft there, co-founders Adam Henderson and Matt Kohlen began developing the Superflux brand by making their beer at other partner breweries in Vancouver, all the while shaping plans for their own physical brewery space. When Superflux Beer Co. finally opened its retail store in the summer of 2020, it was met by a line-up of fans that stretched around the block. Two months later, the tasting lounge opened with just as much excitement. Its stylish interior offers lots of space to spread out with a variety of seating areas. The kitchen features deluxe hot dogs and hyper-seasonal salads. Superflux's bold beer lineup, which is made up of nearly 100% IPAs, is all about experimentation and innovation.

Switchback Brewing,"22775 Dewdney Trunk Rd, Maple Ridge, BC V2X 3K4",49.2207369,-122.5911689,Celebrating a passion for the outdoors and the local community.,"In the spring of 2015, Maple Ridge welcomed its first craft brewery, Maple Meadows Brewing. Then, in the fall of 2023, the brewery changed hands, becoming Switchback Brewing and marking the beginning of an exciting new adventure for its new owners, Chad and Amanda Bergen. Mixing two decades of homebrewing experience with a passion for the great outdoors and the friendly local community, the Bergens' journey began with homebrewing in small apartments, basements, cluttered garages, and even while camping on Rathtrevor Beach! Encouraged by friends and family who've enjoyed their concoctions through the years, Chad and Amanda were spurred on to realize their dream of owning and operating a brewery of their own. Their love for crafting great beer is intertwined with a profound love for nature. As avid outdoor enthusiasts and with Chad's ultramarathon pursuits, their sense of adventure and love for the outdoors is often showcased in the recipes they create. Proud members of Maple Ridge's local community since 2010, the Bergens prioritize giving back to their community by supporting local farmers, other local small businesses, and by bringing people together over a pint of good beer. Tucked between the Golden Ears Mountains and the Fraser River, Maple Ridge is a scenic, forested community with a remarkable natural beauty — and a bounty of craft breweries."
Tailout Brewing,"Unit A 1810 8th Avenue , Castlegar, BC V1N 2Y2",49.2997065,-117.6581364,Where the water is clear and the beer is fresh.,"Founded by friends with a shared love of outdoor activities, especially fly-fishing, Tailout Brewing in Castlegar has a comfortable tasting room that features its stylish fish logo prominently. Indeed, the name “Tailout” refers to a shallow part of a river where fish tend to gather — in other words, a great place to cast a fly. The idea for the brewery came to some Alberta friends while they were sitting in a Banff brewery four years ago. They decided to open their business here in British Columbia for a good reason — “because BC is awesome.” They searched for communities without an existing brewery where they could combine their outdoor passions, and Castlegar was the winner. With several breweries in nearby communities plus the Lion's Head Pub across the river in Robson, the region had been introduced to craft beer already so Tailout was welcomed by the local community when it opened late in 2019. Brewer Mary Lusty studied her craft at Bishop's University and previously worked at Canmore Brewing. She keeps a couple of regular beers on tap and then rotates styles through the other six taps regularly so there is always something fresh and unique to try. Although Tailout doesn't offer its own food, patrons are encouraged to order in from the Grand Buddha Bistro located upstairs or from other local restaurants. The brewery also hosts regular events, including live music, trivia nights, fly-tying clinics, cribbage tournaments, and Pint of Knowledge, a monthly event that features a science speaker talking about their area of knowledge. As if the beer wasn't enough of a draw! Tailout's Mug Club is an annual membership that gives each VIP member a custom hand-made mug to use at the brewery, which provides a 20-oz pour for the price of a 16-oz sleeve, along with discounts on growler fills and merchandise, exclusive cask nights and special release parties, and a free pint on your birthday.

Tapworks Brewing Company,"537 Cruice Lane, Gibsons, BC V0N 1V9",49.4027705,-123.5048225,Crafted for the Coast.,"Three friends worked together to create this small brewery in Gibsons, located just steps from the famous Molly's Reach restaurant of Beachcombers fame. Their goal was to make it a community hub where locals and visitors can gather to enjoy beer and a snack in a comfortable, welcoming setting — and they succeeded. The attractive tasting room hosts musicians and features local artists' creations on the walls. The rooftop patio — yes, you read that right, they have a rooftop patio! — offers a spectacular setting to enjoy food and beer with views of Howe Sound. Pop in for a pint or a sample flight, or fill a growler to take with you as you continue to explore the Sunshine Coast. Their menu is crafted for the coast; each item pairs well with a coastal activity and the Westcoast lifestyle that the Sunshine Coast epitomizes. The Beachcombers ran on CBC television in Canada from 1972 to 1990, one of the longest running series in Canadian history. Set in and around Gibsons, it featured storylines around a pair of beachcombers who earned their living by scouring local beaches for logs that had broken free from logging booms. The hero of the show was Nick Adonidas, played by Bruno Gerussi, while his main rival was an unsavoury character nicknamed Relic, played by Robert Clothier. A café called Molly's Reach featured prominently in the show, but it didn't exist in reality until after the show ended. Today it is a popular tourist attraction in the town. This is the West Coast beyond compare. On BC's southwest coast lies a hidden paradise of coastal geography awaiting discovery — along with some of the province's most distinctive breweries in Gibsons, Sechelt and Powell River."

Located off the Mary Hill Bypass across from Peace Park in Port Coquitlam, Taylight strives to make and serve heart-felt hand-crafted high-quality craft beer while forming meaningful connections with all who come in. Come try classics such as our delicious Hazy Pale Ale, Czech Pilsner, and IPAs — or experience something unique and new that you haven't had before. The open and airy tasting room is the preferred watering hole for the many workers in the surrounding Mary Hill neighbourhood, and is increasingly catching the attention of craft beer enthusiasts from across the Tri-Cities and beyond, too. And for good reason: former Molson brewer Goldwin Chan left the macro world behind to brew his beers his way at Taylight, and the result can be evidenced by the post-work growler fill lineup. The tasting room features 12 draft taps with a lineup that skews towards dangerously crushable IPAs and lagers. And with its proximity to the riverfront Traboulay PoCo Trail connecting Port Coquitlam to Coquitlam and beyond, there's no need to drive when you can bike instead. Beer tastes better when you're biking, anyways.

This all-female ownership model is pretty rare in the beer industry in general, and seems to be unique among the 20+ breweries in Kelowna. Mel and Cathy have been friends for about 20 years with a ton of ideas and an entrepreneurial vision always lurking within their conversations. After a hike and a beer in 2021, they decided it was time to go for it and create their dream of opening a craft brewery. They knew right away that Mel's daughter Tara would be the perfect fit to join their team as the brewer because she had been working as an assistant winemaker for the past few years, which gave her lots of experience with fermentation on an industrial scale. Located near the Kelowna International Airport, the brewery celebrates the local “tri-lakes” region, which includes Skaha, Kalamalka, and Okanagan lakes. Certainly, outdoor activities like camping and boating are a big part of Three Lakes Brewing's theme and branding. This region's craft beer scene dates back 25 years, and a recent surge of new breweries and its own annual beer festival has given it fresh energy."

A retired US Army veteran, Lewis clearly comes by his work ethic honestly. Despite only having a population of 1,000, Valemount has embraced Three Ranges in a big way. The cosy tasting room and sunny patio have become a gathering place for the entire community, and is a great excuse to pull off the highway and take a break. Three Ranges gives back to the community too, with partial proceeds of sales going to local charities and veterans groups. Listen to the Cascadian Beer Podcast episode featuring Three Ranges Brewing.

It started as an idea that two friends, Josh and Craig, had while enjoying some craft beer on a patio in Halifax. Inspired to open their own brewery back in their home town of Nelson, the friends set out on a path that changed their lives. First, they opened a nano-brewery in June of 2014, but found demand for their beer was outpacing their ability to make it. They then set about expanding into a proper micro-brewery, complete with a full lounge. This dream became realized in May 2017 as the new brewery rapidly filled with thirsty patrons. The brewery's lounge has 20 taps, including ciders and guest beers, and also offers wine and craft cocktails. Torchlight makes a wide range of beer styles well, with fun and colourful branding that often refers to videogames or pop culture. The kitchen's offerings are just as impressive as the beer line-up — the head chef even smokes and cures bacon in-house. In addition to its diverse range of beers, Torchlight also produces its own craft sodas, syrups and bitters for cocktails and mixing with soda water.

Townsite Brewing,"5824 Ash Ave, Powell River, BC V8A 4R4",49.8740399,-124.5510398,An iconic brewery in a historic neighbourhood in a unique and interesting BC community.," Townsite Brewing is based in the Federal Building, an architectural treasure with beautiful art deco brickwork built in 1939 to house the post office and other federal agencies in the Townsite area of Powell River. It had been empty and unused for a long time before the owner agreed to invest in the brewery in 2011. Back then, before the current boom of new breweries had really begun, the idea of opening a craft brewery in a remote town two ferries from Vancouver seemed more than a little risky, but Townsite was a hit with the local community from the start and has never looked back. A big part of its success is the skill and approach of Cédric Dauchot, who, for a long time, was the only Belgian-born brewmaster west of Montréal. His wife, Chloe Smith, a brewer herself, is now the brewery GM. Townsite is also the only brewery in BC that is also designated as an Economusée. This program aims to promote and conserve the heritage of traditional skills by showcasing artisans at work as they produce authentic, handcrafted products and contribute innovative ideas to their trade. The Townsite neighbourhood of Powell River is a designated National Historic District. It was built between 1910 and 1930 by the Powell River Paper Company as housing for its employees, following a utopian planning philosophy called the Garden City Movement, which respected the humanity of industrial workers and their families. The paper mill, which began operating in 1912 and is still running today, was the world's largest for a time — at the height of its output, one in every 25 of the world's newspapers was printed on newsprint produced there.The Townsite area features beautifully constructed and well maintained houses built in the Arts and Crafts architectural style — all of which would cost much less than a condo in Vancouver or Victoria.

Trail Beer Refinery,"1299 Bay Avenue, Trail, BC V1R 4A5",49.096744,-117.708301,"With a name that reflects Trail's historic connection to mining, refining, and smelting, this brewery has a strong community focus.","Hours: Tuesday - Saturday 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm For the 13 local business partners who joined together to open Trail's first craft brewery, it was an obvious choice to link its name to the city's main industry. Trail is home to one of the world's largest lead-zinc smelting and refining complexes, which has been a major employer in the region for more than 100 years. The Trail Beer Refinery embraces that history with its decor and branding, and the local community shows its approval by keeping the 100-seat tasting room busy on a regular basis. Don't worry, though, the locals are a friendly bunch who are happy to make room for visitors — as long as you're up for a chat. While you swap travel stories with your new friends over some food and a Trail Ale or a Silver City Lager, maybe ask where the name of the local hockey team, the Smoke Eaters, comes from. Gift cards available for sale only in the taproom Trail has had a hockey team called the Smoke Eaters dating back to the late 1920s. Twice winners of the Allan Cup, which is awarded to the top amateur Senior Men's hockey team in Canada, the “Smokies” represented Canada in the 1939 World Hockey Championship. Leading up to that tournament the team toured Europe, playing a series of 55 exhibition games, losing only once along with one tie. At the World Championship, the Smoke Eaters acting as Team Canada went 8-0, outscoring their opponents 42-1. The Smoke Eaters also represented Canada at the 1961 World Championship and won that tournament as well. Today, the Junior “A” Smoke Eaters play in the British Columbia Hockey League. And where does the name come from? Apparently, it's a reference to workers at the local smelter/refinery who – legend has it – inhaled smoke as part of their job.

And those who bring in their pooch get Happy Hour pricing on the in-house brewed beers. Graeme Macaloney was born in Glasgow, Scotland, where he developed a love for both whisky and beer. When he moved to Canada he set himself the goal of building a place where both would be produced side by side. Macaloney's Island Distillery & Twa Dogs Brewery is just that place. Twa Dogs is a reference to 18th century Scottish poet Robbie Burns; indeed, each beer's name comes from a Burns poem as well. Within its spacious facility is a beautiful tasting room where you can enjoy the full range of beers or a taster's flight of whiskies, which are also available for sale in bottles. Take an entertaining tour to learn more about the brewing and distilling process. You can even enjoy a beer right inside the brewery and watch the brewers as they work. There is also an outdoor patio beside the tasting room. Tours of the brewery and distillery are offered regularly. Click here for more info and to book your tour.

Twin City Brewing Co,"4503 Margaret St, Port Alberni, BC V9Y 6G8",49.2570493,-124.8111792,This hidden gem will win you over with its inventive beers and delicious food.," Port Alberni is a small city at the heart of Vancouver Island. Even though it is geographically closer to the east coast of the Island, it sits at the head of the Alberni Inlet, which extends all the way out to the Pacific Ocean on the west coast. Originally, there were two towns there called Alberni and Port Alberni, but in 1967 they amalgamated to form the city of Port Alberni, which is where the brewery gets its Twin City moniker. Owner Aaron Colyn started out as a homebrewer who decided he wanted to turn beer-making into his profession. It took a while to pull all the pieces together, including a crowdfunding campaign, but the results were well worth the wait. Since opening in 2017 Twin City has earned a great reputation for its creative beer line-up, which often pushes the envelope for what you'd expect to see in an area that doesn't have much previous history with craft beer. To go along with the tasty beer is the equally scrumptious pizza made to order, and the tasty selection of smoked meat sandwiches (yes, the meats are smoked on-site). One visit and you will be hooked by the brewery's welcoming and delicious fare. Twin City Brewing won Best in Show at the 2018 BC Beer Awards for its Late Bloomer strawberry-hibiscus sour. We awarded Twin City with the BC Ale Trail's Best Brewery Experience award in 2020. You can also listen to this Cascadian Beer Podcast episode featuring Twin City Brewing. One of several creatively named pizzas served here is called “Wurst Place to Live,” which features beer-poached brat, caramelized onion and beer cheddar drizzle. The name is a playful reference to a newspaper article that once described Port Alberni as Canada's worst place to live. Well, all we can say is that was definitely before Twin City Brewing opened. Experience craft beer culture interwoven with natural beauty, agricultural splendour and some of BC's most spectacular beaches in Parksville Qualicum Beach, Port Alberni, Ucluelet, Tofino, the Comox Valley, Campbell River, Port McNeill and beyond."
Twin Sails Brewing,"2821 Murray St, Port Moody, BC V3H 1X3",49.278541,-122.848401,"Twin Sails sets itself apart from the crowd on Brewers Row with a focus on progressive American IPAs, Sours and Stouts.","Twin Sails joined Port Moody's Brewers Row late in 2015, opening right next door to Yellow Dog. The name of the brewery refers to its founders, who are twin brothers, as well as the common sight of sailboats on the waters of the Burrard Inlet out front of the brewery. Originally, a focus on German beers such as hefeweizen, gose and pilsner helped Twin Sails stand out from the crowd, but more recently, the brewery expanded its beer list considerably. Now, it is seen as one of the province's leading producers of innovative, cutting-edge IPAs, barrel-aged sours and stouts. What's in a name? With more than 250 breweries in BC, brewery names are beginning to get more and more similar. For example, Twin Sails opened the same year that Nanaimo's White Sails did, and Twin City Brewing opened in Port Alberni in 2017. Colours seem to be the most often used words: Yellow Dog, Black Kettle, Red Truck, Red Collar and Red Arrow. With multiple unique breweries on Brewers Row, beer lovers agree that Port Moody is anything but sleepy—it's a craft beer destination."

Originally built in the early 1950s, St. Aiden's Church was deconsecrated in 2010. The idea of converting the building into a microbrewery was conceived between three local friends in 2015. After a few false starts, a concerted effort allowed it to open five years later following a complete interior renovation. The brewery's opening, however, coincided with the arrival of the pandemic in 2020. Nonetheless, Ucluelet Brewing has thrived since then, becoming the community gathering place its founders hoped it would be. The natural beauty of the building's wooden architecture has been preserved and enhanced with repurposed and salvaged wood. For instance, the wood that fronts the bar and kitchen comes from the joists that were cut out of the floor where the brewing equipment is. And prior to that use they came from a building at the World War II-era Seaplane base so that wood has been re-used twice already! A diversity of award-winning beer is offered on tap, in cans, kegs and growlers. There is a patio overlooking the harbour, and a warm, comfortable vibe inside. The tiny kitchen punches way above its weight and produces hearty and wholesome food atypical of your standard pub fare. Follow this link for more info on the renovation of St. Aiden's Church.

Ursa Minor Brewing,"45249 Ootsa Lake Road East, Burns Lake, BC V0J1E4",53.955652,-125.829615,Journey to this Lakes District brewery for beer with a northern vibe.,"Ursa Minor's tasting room is open from May to October. Check out their updated tasting room and outdoor picnic area. This farm-based brewery is based on Little Bear Ranch, a 540-acre cattle farm in the Lakes District of Northern BC about 100km south of the community of Burns Lake. Nathan Nicholas' parents Harold and Leona developed and operated the ranch for 45 years, but Nathan and his wife Gwyn's own aspirations led them to lease the ranch land to neighbours and switch their focus to building a brewery. They still operate a smaller part of the farm, raising pigs and growing berries, rhubarb, haskap, juniper and other crops, many of which will make its way into the beers they brew. The brewery is based in a converted airplane hangar originally built by Nathan's father who was also an avid pilot. As they were converting the building in the summer of 2018, wildfires forced them to evacuate for three weeks. Luckily, the farm was spared and no one was hurt. Construction was completed with the help of neighbours, friends and family, and the brewery finally opened in 2020. Getting to Ursa Minor is part of the adventure — it involves a free public ferry that crosses François Lake and some dirt roads so be sure to plan ahead and check the brewery's hours. It's a great day trip from Burns Lake or perhaps stay overnight at the nearby Takysie Lake Resort and explore the Ootsa-François Lake Circle Tour. You can even stay at the brewery's own cabin or one of several tent sites. Majestic scenery and abundant natural beauty makes exploring Burns Lake, Kitimat, Prince Rupert, Terrace, Smithers, and Prince George the perfect epic road trip, where you end a long day of driving with delicious craft beer."

At Kelowna's Vice & Virtue Brewing, the concept from the very beginning has been to create an exceptional (and thoroughly hip) food and beer experience. Here, everything is house-made from the contemporary and creative craft beers—many of which are wine-inspired—to the cured and smoked meats, all locally-sourced. Not only does the brewery collaborate with local wineries and farms in creating its beers, but with its food menu as well. The result is a food program that's equally as impressive as Vice & Virtue's beer. The brewery is smack dab in the middle of the exploding North End craft beer district, with a sleek, open-concept tasting room, offering unobstructed views into the brewery itself, as well as the kitchen. With its whitewashed walls and minimalist aesthetic, it wouldn't look out of place in East Vancouver, so don't be surprised if you find a lineup snaking out the front door.

The original location was a former construction shop playfully known as “the bunker” due to its lack of windows. This small brewery became a big hit with locals who embraced its rustic and cosy charm, and fell in love with its creative and well-made beers. The atmosphere was jovial and unpretentious, with live music acts performing on the weekends. Flash forward nearly a decade to when the Wheelhouse's three founders were presented with an opportunity to take over the former waterfront railway station, which was built in 1922 using Tyndall stone imported from the Prairies. It served the community until the early '90s and had been sitting empty ever since. How could they say no? It was another diamond in the rough beckoning to have its walls filled with the yeasty scent of beer and the chatter of customers.  The move into the new space occurred in the spring of 2023. The new location is much larger, which will allow the brewers to make more beer than they could given space limitations in the original location. It also has windows — lots of them! The second level boasts a sunroom with 270 degrees of glass facing southwest toward the ocean. Another improvement is the addition of a kitchen, including a pizza oven imported from Italy.

It looks like it's been in its space for a long time, but in fact it only just opened in the summer of 2019. That's how well designed its space is, making visitors feel welcome the moment they enter the tasting room, which was inspired by the coastal environment of Vancouver Island and the urban energy of downtown Victoria. And the sun-drenched patio just can't be beat in the warmer months. Whistle Buoy's beers are tasty and diverse — the tap list explores a wide range of flavours, including cutting edge styles as well as classics from the brewers' canon. Enjoy a flight and take a crowler or two away with you. The brewery has a basic snacks menu, and welcomes visitors to bring their own food, perhaps from one of the restaurants in Market Square. Dogs are welcome on the patio. The brewery's unusual name comes from the diving location where its three founders first decided to open their own brewery. There they liked to go spear fishing for rock cod while free diving (i.e. without scuba equipment). Yup, there's a reason why some spear guns are mounted on the wall of the tasting room.

Its original incarnation went through several ownership changes, with the brand even owned by Alberta's Big Rock Brewery for a while. However, as the 2010 Winter Olympic Games approached, the brewery returned to Whistler and opened a facility in Function Junction, a light industrial neighbourhood south of the Village. Not only did this solidify the connection residents feel with the brewery, but it also provided a place for visitors to taste the beer and see it being made first hand. Whistler isn't just for snowboarders and ski fanatics. It's a world-class year-round destination with some of Canada's best restaurants, shopping and sightseeing opportunities. It's also a mecca for mountain bikers with many miles of trails, including the Top of the Mountain trail that descends 5,000 feet from the top of Whistler Mountain to the Village.

The building's location has a connection to Nanaimo brewing history: It was once the site of the Newcastle Hotel that was owned by John Mahrer, brewmaster of Nanaimo Brewing, one of the earliest breweries in the city back in the 1890s. There's something to think about while you enjoy a glass of fresh beer today! According to a story in the Nanaimo Daily Bulletin (http://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/382560621.html), one night in 1892, a ship called the Glory of the Seas berthed in Nanaimo harbour late at night and nine sailors disembarked looking for a place to drink some beer. Unfortunately, the saloons were all closed but they knocked on the door of the Empire Brewery and found the brewmaster still there, working all alone. Apparently the brewmaster was so frightened by the sight of all these sailors, he hid himself in a broom closet. The sailors entered the brewery and drank five dozen or so bottles of beer between them, leaving $1.80 as payment. The next day, they were arrested and charged with being drunk and disorderly. The brewmaster, who kept the money, was also fined for selling liquor after hours.

It took a while to build this brewery — the first new commercial building in Golden in 25 years — but it was worth the wait because the location on the ski hill road on the rejuvenated north side of downtown is perfect. While they waited, local business partners Kent Donaldson and Mark Nagao worked closely with a professional brewer to perfect recipes on Donaldson's custom-built homebrewing system in his garage. Since then, this popular brewery has developed a strong reputation for its beer lineup by winning several major awards. Considering this is the first craft brewery in a relatively small community, the beer lineup is surprisingly challenging, but Donaldson says the Belgian beers he insisted on including “resonate with the locals” even more than he expected. Visitors seem to be equally impressed based on how busy the tasting room and patio are throughout the year.

In the heart of wine country, this ambitious brewery focuses on barrel-aged, small-batch beers often inspired by the methods and ingredients of its winemaking neighbours. Wild Ambition uses winery-style fermentation tanks, ages its beer in B.C. wine barrels, and carbonates them naturally, not unlike the méthode traditionnelle used in champagne. Local fruits and ingredients also factor heavily in Wild Ambition's beers—few breweries in the province place such an importance in terroir. While the brewery and tasting room itself are located in a nondescript, industrial subdivision in North Kelowna, the flavours Wild Ambition produces are rich and rustic with an earthy farmhouse funk. Many of their beers are suitable to be cellared, allowing them to develop even more complexity over time. It's little wonder that Wild Ambition's mercurial beers are increasingly developing a following across the province.

The brewery has a tasting room and growler station up front with a big picnic area behind the brewery. In 2013, the provincial government allowed breweries to open outdoor picnic areas, a privilege wineries had previously enjoyed. Picnickers can consume beer, but the breweries may not directly serve them the beer in the picnic area. In other words, patrons have to carry their beers to the picnic tables themselves. There are not very many picnic areas at breweries in BC because most of them are located in industrial areas, but three of the Port Moody breweries have them: Yellow Dog, Parkside and Moody Ales. Other breweries with picnic areas include Persephone, Gladstone, and Rossland. With multiple unique breweries on Brewers Row, beer lovers agree that Port Moody is anything but sleepy—it's a craft beer destination."
